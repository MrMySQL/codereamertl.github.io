<p>3) Corporate Volunteering</p>
<p>As active members of the communities in which they live, many of our employees donate their time, knowledge,
    experience, and money to help local charities, as well supporting Codereamer's charitable projects. This includes
    support for orphanages, talks on IT for school and college students, and charity match fundraising. There are three
    main focus areas - plastic recycling, paper recycling and energy saving.</p>
